This project sets up a message server, database server and web server to handle data from and to ESP8266 Internet of Things units. 
The servers are on a Raspberry Pi and all the data is kept locally. An example ESP8266 project to record data from two electricity meters using phototransisor pulse counters 
is detailed. Five simple interface scripts are included which only need minor modification for other projects. The core programs Mosquitto, Mysql, Gnuplot and Apache 
are all well proven, reliable and open source.
